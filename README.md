### Hi I’m @KB3HNS
I have 20+ years of experience in electronics and software engineering focusing on new product development.  I specialize in control applications in automotive, industrial process control, and most recently medical devices. 

My primary languages are C, C++, and Python, but I have also written embedded applications using assembly for 8051, ARM, PPC, 6800, 6502, and z80 architectures.  I also have written software in C#, Perl, PHP, SQL, and several different shell scripts.

I'm also interested in Amateur radio, and household craftsmanship (drywalling, woodwork, electrical installation, plumbing, flooring, etc).  Last, but not least, I'm a hard-core die-hard _"Yinzer"_ Penguins fan.

Feel free to look me up on [LinkedIn][1] and connect.  Let me know that you're coming from GitHub.
