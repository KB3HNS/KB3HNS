Hi I’m @KB3HNS
I have 20+ years of experience in electronics and software engineering focusing on new product development.  I specialize in control applications in automotive, industrial process control, and most recently medical devices. 
My primary languages are C, C++, and Python, but I have also used assembly for 8086, 8051, ARM, PPC, 8051, and z80.  I also am familiar with and have used C#, Perl, PHP, SQL, and several different shell scripts.
I'm also interested in Amateur radio, and household cratsmanship (drywalling, woodwork, electrical installation, plumbing, flooring, etc).
