### Hi I’m @KB3HNS
I have 20+ years of experience in electronics and software engineering focusing on new product development.  I specialize in control applications in automotive, industrial process control, and most recently medical devices. 

My primary languages are C, C++, and Python, but I have also used assembly for 8086, 8051, ARM, PPC, 8051, and z80.  I also am familiar with and have used C#, Perl, PHP, SQL, and several different shell scripts.

I'm also interested in Amateur radio, and household craftsmanship (drywalling, woodwork, electrical installation, plumbing, flooring, etc).  Last, but not least, I'm a hard-core die-hard _"Yinzer"_ Penguins fan.

Feel free to look me up on [LinkedIn][1] and connect.  Let me know that you're coming from GitHub.
